# Search-Box-Project
I used react for this project, and yarn for the package manager
How to run:
First execute the 'yarn install' command if your using yarn to install the dependencies and then when installed execute the 'yarn start' command. If you would like to use npm instead, similary use npm instead of yarn. When you start the project it must automatically launch in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
